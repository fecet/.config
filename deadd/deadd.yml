    ### Matches the notifications against these rules. If all of the
    ### values (of one modification rule) match, the "modify"/"script"
    ### part is applied.
    # - match:
    ### Possible match criteria:
    # title: "Notification title"
    # body: "Notification body"

    ### is expected to return JSON/YAML configuration that defines the
    ### modifications that should be applied. Minimum complete return
    ### value must be '{"modify": {}, "match": {}}'. Always leave the "match"
    ### object empty (technical reasons, i.e. I am lazy).
